Change Summary

1.1.1

2011-10-20
* add DataType classes to replace the use of strings for types.
  - Completely rework the interpretation of JsonSchema into DataTypes to
    make them clearer.
* A large set of refactorings in an ongoing effort to make Api definitions
  distinct from the language we will generate in
  - add LanguageModel, which each language subclasses to provide utililes
    for formatting DataTypes for use in templates
  - defer creation of codeType from API parsing to code generation, using
    the pair of LanguageModel and DataType to emit the right thing.
* Add Packages to the things which can appear in code. Use package.name in
  templates rather than explictly building relative paths.
* Add a parent/child relationship between data models. This is to pave the
  way for generators which represent anonymous classes as nested classes.
* Add tags for building parameter lists. This moved the code to create those
  lists from Annotators buried in the per-language generators out to templates.
* Add a 'call_template' tag to make it factor out common template idioms.
